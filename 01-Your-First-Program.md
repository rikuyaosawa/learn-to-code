## What is a Program?

As we start diving into the world of programming, let's take a moment to consider this question: **What is a program?**

In short, **a program is a set of instruction that can be executed to perform a specific task.**

In other words, it's you telling the computer what to do, and how to do it.

Let's take a look at an example, shall we?

Ok, let's say we tell our computer to do a calculation for us. I'm going to keep it simple and ask for some arithmetic calculations. Take a look at the following instructions:

- do `1 + 1`.

One simple instruction. But how do we write it using programming? Oh, real easy.

```
1 + 1
```

Wow, that was easy, wasn't it. Apparently programming languages have arithmetic operators such as `+` and `-`, and many others. Math is one of the many things we can tell computers to do.

Let's add something to this program.

Say:

- output the result of the calculation `1 + 1` so I can see it.

Ok, we can do the following using programming, because, we are programmers, right?

```js
console.log(1 + 1);
```

Woah, what is `console.log`?? No worries, this just tells the computer to "log" the output of the calculation to the place called "console". It's basically where computers can spit out whatever it wants so that humans can read it, interact with it, and so forth.

You will see this `console.log` many, many more times!!

## Hands On: "Hello, World!"

It's time to get your hands dirty.

We are going to use Google Chrome browser as our editor, where we write our programs, for the time being. It is really easy and quick to get started wit it.

Let's make our computer say "Hello, World!" to us. Why `Hello, World!` ? Well, it's traditional. Or a meme. Programming meme, you could say. It's something us programmers do when we make a fresh start at, for example, a programming language, or some other technology related stuff.

Notice this time **we are wrapping the words with quotations**. We need to because we are telling the computer the words wrapped inside the quotations are not numbers, but "words". As we shall discuss this more in details later, these number and "words" are called **data type**. Data types are used so that the computer can understand our instructions better and with more flexibility.

#### JavaScript

The programming language we are using here is called `JavaScript`. It is a language that revolutionized the world of websites, and still one of if not the most popular language today in 2025.

We are not going into the details of the language itself and how it came to be now, but things such as web browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox) all use JavaScript, not to mentions the millions of websites out there require JavaScript to function.

## Recap

Congrats! Your very first computer program.

Here's what you want to take home today:

- **A computer program is a set of instructions that a computer executes to perform a specific task.** And a computer is comprised of billions of these to do what it does.
- With program, you could do arithmetic calculations, print out words, and much more!

So what do "programmers" do? Write instructions so that computers can perform its miracle! And these instructions are called program.
